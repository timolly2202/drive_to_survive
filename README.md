# drive_to_survive

> **AI in Robotics group project using an Audi model from PFMS** to learn a race track and increase speed.  
> **ROS 2** (Humble or Foxy) + Gazebo + RViz environment.

## Overview

This repository contains the **drive_to_survive** project, demonstrating an autonomous driving workflow in Gazebo. It includes:

- A race track world and an *“audibot”* (Audi) vehicle model
- ROS 2 launch files for running Gazebo and RViz
- Scripts or nodes for controlling the robot, sensor data visualization, and basic autonomy
- Example Xacro and URDF definitions for the Audi with multiple sensors (LIDAR, RGB-D cameras, etc.)

The goal is to:
1. Launch a simulated race track with an Audi vehicle
2. Use sensor data (e.g. LIDAR, camera) to learn or follow the track
3. Develop AI/ML strategies to optimize lap times or handle obstacles.

## Folder Structure

- **drive_to_survive/**: root folder with all packages. Like a ros2_ws. We build from here. 
- **install/**, **log/**, **/build**: Usually generated by `colcon build` and ROS 2 logging. rm- rf before building on own system.  
- **launch/**: All the `.launch.py` files for starting Gazebo, spawning the robot, opening RViz, etc. DEPRECATED: Launch files are stored in resources under drive_to_survive/resources/gazebo_tf/launch
- **resource/**: Resource is in case we want to make a py package later, and contains an empty drive_to_survive script.
- **resources/**: Resources holds all relevant resource to the project. Additional or standard naming for storing URDF/xacro, meshes, and package definitions.  
- **src/**: Contains the symlinks to ROS 2 packages used for the environment: `audibot`, `gazebo_tf`, etc.
- **machine_learning**: will store our M-L and AIR python scripts we want to execute. We can also spin ros nodes or use rospy here.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository into your workspace:** 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:TejasB4/drive_to_survive.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

3. **Symbolically link audi related packages from PFMS**
```bash
cd drive_to_survive
# optional - remove existing src and create your own for symlink
rm -rf src
mkdir src
# In the drive_to_survive/ top-level
ln -s ../resources/audibot/audibot             src/audibot
ln -s ../resources/audibot/audibot_description src/audibot_description
ln -s ../resources/audibot/audibot_gazebo      src/audibot_gazebo
ln -s ../resources/gazebo_tf                   src/gazebo_tf
```

4. **Build Packages**
```bash
cd ~/drive_to_survive
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```

5. **Launch Environment**
```bash
ros2 launch drive_to_survive drive_to_survive.launch.py
# default launch config is RVIZ only, no gazebo
ros2 launch drive_to_survive drive_to_survive.launch.py gui:=true use_rviz:=false # to launch gazebo and no rviz
ros2 launch drive_to_survive drive_to_survive.launch.py gui:=false use_rviz:=true # to launch rviz and no gazebo
```
